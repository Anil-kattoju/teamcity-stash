You can then see build statuses against commits.\r\n\r\n ![Stash screenshot](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8529642406_29e3e9a899_o.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n==========\r\n\r\nDownload the [.zip file](https://github.com/mendhak/teamcity-stash/blob/master/teamcity.stash.zip?raw=true) and place it in the `<TeamCity data directory>/plugins` folder, then restart TeamCity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSet-up\r\n==========\r\n\r\nUnder your build steps, click on `Add Build Feature`. It will appear in the dropdown list.\r\n\r\n![Build Feature](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8088/8529641968_ba34b8ebac_o.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSimply enter your Stash server details and credentials to connect with. The plugin will now send build status updates to your Stash server.\r\n\r\n![Configuration](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8365/8528530651_801fc3214d_o.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n======\r\n\r\nThis is a TeamCity Build Feature built using the [TeamCity Open API](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD7/Developing+TeamCity+Plugins).\r\n\r\nIt listens for build statuses and posts them to the [Atlassian Stash Build API](https://developer.atlassian.com/static/rest/stash/latest/stash-build-integration-rest.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nGPL v2\r\n\r\n\r\n______________\r\n\r\n\r\nCode setup\r\n=====\r\nYou will need [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) as this project uses IDEA features to build artifacts.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to download and extract [TeamCity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/) which provides the required jars.\r\n\r\nOpen the project in Intellij IDEA, you should see a lot of unresolved references, this is normal.\r\n\r\nGo to `File | Settings | Path Variables` and set the `TeamCityDistribution` variable, pointing it to your TeamCity location.\r\n\r\nThe project should now build.  The .zip is generated in `/out/artifacts/plugin_zip`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
